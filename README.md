# libeqsolve
A C Library of pseudospectral methods to solve PDE's

## Currently implemented methods
* Exponential Time Differencing Runge-Kutta of:
  * First order
  * Second order
  * Third order
  * Fourth order

They assume real linear part and therefore is not the most general implementation


## TO-DO
* ETDRK with complex linear part
* a proper documentation
